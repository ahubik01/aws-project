@everyone I hope you had read through Pass task that due next week
I really really really need your involvement to the Jira board because we need to do some admin tasks on that

10:17pm - ChiTrungLai
Please pick up a task that you think you could handle

I think I'm assigned to some tasks already? Do I have to confirm on Jira?

10:40pm - ChiTrungLai
I don't think si
so

10:41pm - Angus Upshall
Is there more I need to do from being assigned a task?

10:41pm - ChiTrungLai
I think we don't need to actually build the solfware. Just pretend that we excecuting tasks
Have a look in the lecture recording as well
This is my understanding so far

10:44pm - Angus Upshall
I'm away from my laptop tonight but will be back home tomorrow morning. What aside from task assignment needs to be done?

10:44pm - ChiTrungLai
These
I can do the burndown chart, and I need others to do other tasks

10:46pm - Angus Upshall
I can take minutes for the stand ups

10:46pm - ChiTrungLai
Cool, we'd need 5 days of it
What I am gonna do is to ask for extension
Because the burndown chart is a live capture time thing
We can't lie about it
So I did recorded today's burndown chart, and till Monday it is 3 days -> so we need until Wednesday to have all of them line up
