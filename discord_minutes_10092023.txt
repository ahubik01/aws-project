5 days is okay for part A but part B is also another 5 days so that makes 10 days in total.. can we fit it all in?
I'd be happy to do the github syncing and status recording..

I think it’s not necessary be 10 days
If you watch the recording Oshani explained about it and she gave an example
In that example the previous student did 5 days

oh okay thats fine then

Also this is done within 1 week so i don’t see the point of completing it 10 days tho
(I mean the deadline from the previous task)
